# How to Contribute

This projcet is still in its early stages.

The best way to get involved is to join the [CHAOSS Slack](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/) in the #data-ai-detection-action channel to be part of the conversation.

We hope to start better documenting our planned tasks, enforcing a pull request based workflow (potentially with DCO signoff) and creating more documentation in the near future
